A total of 40 teams (teams ranked 1-27 in the CAF entrant list and 13 first round winners) played home-and-away over two legs. The 20 winners advanced to the third round.
Seeding

The draw for the second round was held as part of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Preliminary Draw on 25 July 2015, starting 18:00 MSK (UTC+3), at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, Russia.[2][3][4]

The seeding was based on the FIFA World Rankings of July 2015 (shown in parentheses).[5] The 27 direct qualifiers are seeded into three pots:

    Pot 1 contained the teams ranked 1-13.
    Pot 2 contained the teams ranked 14-20.
    Pot 3 contained the teams ranked 21-27.

Each tie contained a team from Pot 1 and a first round winner (first 13 ties) which were automatically allocated into each tie (winner of first round tie 1 into second round tie 1, etc.), or a team from Pot 2 and a team from Pot 3 (last seven ties), with the team from Pot 1 or Pot 2 hosting the second leg. As the draw was held before the first round was played, the identities of the first round winners were not known at the time of the draw.

Note: Bolded teams qualified for the third round.

Format

A total of 20 teams which advanced from the second round will be drawn into five groups of four teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches. The winners of each group will qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
Seeding

The draw for the third round was held on 24 June 2016, 17:00 EET (UTC+2), at the CAF headquarters in Cairo, Egypt.[1]

The seedings - initially released on 8 June 2016 - were based on a special edition of the FIFA World Rankings that included all matches up to 7 June 2016. This allowed the rankings to include results of the Africa Cup of Nations qualification games played between 3-5 June 2016.[2] However, following a complaint by the Egyptian Football Association, it was reported that a further special ranking would be used.[3] This seeding was released on 21 June.[4] Following further complaints,[5] the Emergency Bureau for the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers reversed the change, and restored the initial special rankings.[6]

    Pot 1 contained the teams ranked 1-5.
    Pot 2 contained the teams ranked 6-10.
    Pot 3 contained the teams ranked 11-15.
    Pot 4 contained the teams ranked 16-20.

Each group contains one team from each of the four pots. The fixtures of each group were decided based on the respective draw position of each team, which was decided by drawing a ball with position numbers 1-4.[7]
