The 2010 Caribbean Cup (also known as Digicel Caribbean Cup 2010 for sponsorship reasons) was the 2010 edition of the Caribbean Championship, an international football championship for national teams affiliated with the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) of the CONCACAF region. The final stage was hosted by Martinique. Martinique were selected as hosts over fellow bidders Guadeloupe and Barbados. The competition was originally scheduled to begin on 18 August with the final match taking place on 28 November.[1] However, at the beginning of August 2010, the CFU released a different schedule that showed the competition being postponed until 2 October.[2] Also, the Bahamas pulled out of the competition, leaving 23 teams. The groups were changed, allowing Cuba and Antigua and Barbuda to get a bye to the second qualifying round at the expense of Guyana and the Netherlands Antilles.

The top four teams qualified for the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

Qualification
Main article: 2012 Caribbean Cup qualification

The first and second rounds were scheduled for August and September, and October respectively. The draw for the qualifying round was made in March 2012.

The following teams qualified:

     Antigua and Barbuda (Automatic qualification as host)
     Jamaica (Automatic qualification as holders)
     Haiti (Qualification as Group 6 winners)
     French Guiana (Qualification as Group 6 runners-up)
     Dominican Republic (Qualification as Group 7 winners)
     Martinique (Qualification as Group 7 runners-up)
     Trinidad and Tobago (Qualification as Group 8 winners)
     Cuba (Qualification as Group 8 runners-up)

Preparations

This is the first international tournament organised by the CFU since the corruption scandal. Prior to hosting the tournament, Paul "Chet" Greene, a former General Secretary of the Antigua and Barbuda Football Association raised concerns that Antigua's FA may not be able to afford to host the tournament and suggested that it would require state aid. It was the incumbent ABFA General Secretary Derrick Gordon that went on to become the President of the Caribbean Football Union and ultimately select the host nation. Greene stated, "Antigua [are] not necessarily in a position to give as [much] they normally would, I think government becomes the only option at this stage and a call for larger than usual attendances to allow the association to pay the bills." Greene also said that in the event of a grant from the CFU (via CONCACAF), the association would "still have a chunk of expenses to bear."[6]

ABFA President Everton Gonsalves responded, "the value to football is not something that can be valued in dollars."[7] CFU President Gordon Derrick stated that "Football is an expensive venture in all aspects; development comes at a cost so monies have to be spent."[7] At the 2013 CFU Congress, Derrick Gordon stated that they could not come to an agreement with usual sponsors Digicel as they "couldn't agree on a deal in time for the Caribbean Cup, as Digicel's budget year had closed."[8]
Venues

Two venues have been chosen to host the tournament.[6]

Draw

Teams were allocated to this stage based on a fixed draw. The draw was decided thus:[9]

Group A

    Host
    Group 6 winner
    Group 7 runners-up
    Group 8 winner



Group B

    Previous competition winner
    Group 6 runner-up
    Group 7 winner
    Group 8 runner-up

The result of the draw was amended on 19 November, the Group 7 runner-up was transferred to Group B and the Group 7 winner was transferred to Group A.[10] As a result of the amendment Group A contains three qualifying group winners and the host, whilst Group B contains three qualifying group runners-up and the previous edition competition winner. Martinique, the team transferred to Group B containing no qualifying group-winners, is the only association in the competition with a CFU Executive Committee member (Maurice Victoire) besides hosts Antigua and Barbuda (Gordon Derrick).
Group stage

The complete schedule for finals was released on 20 November.[11]

The 2014 Caribbean Cup was the 18th edition of the Caribbean Cup, an international football competition for national teams of member nations affiliated with the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) of the CONCACAF region.

The final competition stage (8 teams) was scheduled for 11-18 November.[1] On 18 March 2014, it was announced that Jamaica would host the final stage.[2]

For the first time, the competition and its qualifying stages were scheduled to take place during officially sanctioned FIFA international match periods. The change was made to assist the national Football Associations selecting high profile Caribbean players whose clubs would be otherwise reluctant to lose the players service while on international duty. Previous editions of the competition have taken place on non-FIFA calendar dates. Horace Burrell, the Jamaican Football Federation President stated that the change would "ensure the tournament has star power".[2]

The top four teams would qualify for the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup automatically while the fifth place team would advance to a play-off against the fifth place team from the 2014 Copa Centroamericana tournament.[2] This is the first time that the two overall fifth-placed teams compete to qualify for the CONCACAF Gold Cup, previously five teams from Central America and four from the Caribbean have qualified for the Confederation's competition.

The winner of the tournament would qualify for the Copa América Centenario, a 16-team tournament of CONMEBOL and CONCACAF national teams to be held in the United States in 2016.[3]

1. French Guiana and Martinique are not FIFA members, and so do not have a FIFA Ranking.
2. This is Curacao's first appearance since the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, as its direct successor (with regards to membership in football associations), inheriting the former nation's FIFA membership and competitive record.
